                  Worst case and Best case results did not have huge difference which proved usage of theta instead of BigO or Omega.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Sort ran slower than the merge sort and resulted in similar answers with different arrangements. Which was also shown as
                  Worst case and Best case results did not have huge difference which further proved usage of theta instead of BigO or Omega.
